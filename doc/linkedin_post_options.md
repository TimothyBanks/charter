## Guidance

- Avoid cryptic posts.
- Be specific about problem, progress, and ask.
- Keep claims credible and verifiable.

## Option 1: Design Partner Focus

We’re building a custody-native blockchain protocol where governance controls are enforced on-chain, not in private workflow software.

Current PoC enforces:
- approval thresholds
- timelocks
- transfer limits
- destination whitelist checks
- compliance attestation gating

Consensus is BFT with a vetted validator model.  
CometBFT is our rapid prototyping rail; production direction is ConcordBFT / dedicated BFT architecture.

I’m looking for 2-3 institutional design partners (custody, exchange ops, treasury ops) to pressure-test requirements and pilot workflows.

If this is relevant, message me.

## Option 2: Investor/Strategic Buyer Focus

Most institutional custody controls still live off-chain in opaque internal systems.

I’m building a protocol that makes custody policy execution deterministic and auditable on-chain:
- policy-driven intent lifecycle
- immutable approval and attestation records
- regulator-friendly verification path

The model is public-read + permissioned validator set, with per-transaction fees (not enterprise license lock-in).

If you invest in or acquire infrastructure in custody/compliance/market structure, I’d welcome a conversation.

## Option 3: Regulator-Readiness Focus

What if custody governance was verifiable at protocol level instead of hidden in internal back-office software?

I’m working on a BFT custody protocol where:
- on-chain state is the canonical record
- institutions use deterministic policy controls
- regulators can independently validate activity from mainnet data

PoC complete on CometBFT; production architecture now being shaped toward ConcordBFT / custom BFT.

Open to conversations with institutions, policy experts, and infrastructure partners.

## Option 4: Hiring + Build-in-Public Angle

I’ve been building a custody-specific blockchain protocol and now need partners to help move from PoC to pilot.

Current stack:
- deterministic custody state machine
- BFT consensus integration (PoC)
- policy controls for threshold/timelock/limits/whitelist/claims

Next:
- production consensus architecture
- validator governance
- regulator evidence tooling

If you’ve shipped regulated infrastructure and want to collaborate, reach out.
